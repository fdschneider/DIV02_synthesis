Presented the project at synthesis meeting in Bern. 
Some discussion led to the following issues: 

- Santi suggests to test interactive effects in the SEM of LUI and the PC axes. 
- Dani: reconsider r-K terminology, because controversial regarding size. rathre tall--short
- Fons: Why funnel shaped PCA patterns? Mathematical artifact
- Correlation is counter-intuitive: LUI should foster fast growing plants. Currently opposite is the case
- Santi: Test top-down effects as opposed to bottom-up. Predators on Herbivores on Plants
- How to enter temporal effects? causality analysis

- Soil data: Protists? 
- Bacteria: 2011 data of soil propoerties and major groups of bacteria are available, no OTU based analysis yet. (ask Kirstin Kaiser)
