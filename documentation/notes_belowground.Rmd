# Soil PLFA based measures

## Fungal/Bacteria ratio

include!
 
based on PLFA markers, 

## Cmic, Nmic ratio

Definitely include!
A ratio ~ 5 marks bacterial dominance. 

## Ergosterol

fungal marker (protein of biomembrane) incompatible with PLFA measurements, 

## Protozoa/Invertebrates

PLFA marker for invertebrate 


## Enzyme activities

- nitrification
- denitrification 

- Urease: corresponds to fertilization and grazing activity
- phosphatase: acidity (pH) of soils 
- beta-Glucosidase: litter decomposition and cellulose degradation
- xylosidase: stonger activity in decomposition, hemicellulose decomposition
- chitinase/n-acetyl-beta-glucosamidase: carbon breakdown, litter decomposition, responds to high density of soil invertebrates

Representation of potential function, due to buffering. Might be included because soil groups are interestet? Maybe map as predictor traits? Better include metagenomic data: OTU plus functional traits. 

Fierer et al 2006 Ecology, Trait spectra of microbes. Current work? Activity on traits by Core microbiology group: J. Overmann? 

Data assembled by the core synthesis project. 


# Fungi (Tesfaye Wubet, Kezia Goldmann)

OTU species lists, grouping of:

- saprotrophs, 
- pathogens, 
- arbuscular myc., 
- ectomyc., 
- ericacea myc.

calculate proportions of those (binary to cwm)

In grasslands, myccorhiza are minor. Dominance of saprotrophs and pathogenic fungi. 

Bexis IDs

available for 2011; data for 2014 can be priorized if needed. 

# protist data on Acanthamoeba and Myxomycetes (Michael Bonkowski, Anna-Maria Fiore-Donno)

First of all, our sequencing nearly reached saturation - that means the 
sequences per site are not found due to merely chance events, but 
reflect the 'real' diversity in that group.
Second, both groups are phylogenetically highly diverse, and they showed 
high beta diversity between grassland sites.
If you need it, we can also assign real taxonomic names to the OTUs, 
although as often for protists, some "species" are species clusters with 
broad phylogenetic dispersion, and other "species" occur repeatedly on 
distant branches in the phylogeny, showing that they are in fact several 
different taxa. Therefore "OTU" is more reliable for non-experts.

BeXis dataset IDs are:
18166 Aca AEG
18207 Aca HEG
18208 Aca SEG
18226 Myx AEG
18187 Myx HEG
18206 Myx SEG

The data are fully accessible as supplementary material in our article:

At your disposal should you need more information!

# Bacterial metagenome data (Rolf Daniel, Kristin Kaiser, Heiko Nacke, GÃ¶ttingen)

OTUs for 2011 are analysed and online on Bexis (#19526), resolved for taxa. Translate taxa using Fierer scheme.
