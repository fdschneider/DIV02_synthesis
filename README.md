# Synthesis: Is there whole ecosystem level synchrony in functional trait distribution?


## Data

We plan to focus on the grassland plot data of the Biodiversity Exploratories, because trait data are more complete and due to the expertise of the group involved. Future work may ex-tend to forest ecosystems.

### plot-level species abundance data (over time)

The plot-level assessments of species abundances (Simons et al. 2014, 2015, 2016) will be used to compile community weighted means, variances and skewness metrics of traits per trophic guild for each plot at each point in time.

#### Arthropod Core project data (Martin Gossner, Nadja Simons)

#### Botany Core Project data (Markus Fischer)

#### Pollinator data from (Nico Bl√ºthgen)

#### Macroarthropod predators from SoilFoodWeb project (Klaus Birkhofer)

#### Microbioal data from microSYSteM & SCALEMIC project (Ellen Kandeler, Barbara Stempfhuber)

#### Protist data from NanoFauna project (Hartmut Arndt)



### species trait data per trophic guild

We require data on species traits for multiple functional groups of the above and below ground ecosystem compartment. At minimum we would like to include plants, herbivores, predators, and soil microbial community. These data have already been compiled by Gossner et al (2015). Further functional groups could easily be included if data are available (e.g. para-sitoids, root feeders, pollinators ).



### plot-level data of land-use intensity factors 

The standard plot data of the Biodiversity Exploratories provide information on grazing, mowing and fertilization frequencies, compiled into the Land Use Index (LUI). We will explore which of those factors, or their combination, best predicts the synchrony of changes in trait distribution.
