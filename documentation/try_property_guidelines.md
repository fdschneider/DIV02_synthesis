# Intellectual Property Guidelines for the TRY Initiative

The following guidelines apply to issues of data ownership and intellectual property within the TRY initiative. TRY is a network of vegetation scientists founded by Sandra Diaz (Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Argentina), Sandra Lavorel (Centre d Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive, CNRS, Montpellier, France), Colin Prentice (Imperial College, London, UK), Paul Leadley (Universite Paris-Sud, France), Christian Wirth (University of Leipzig, Germany), Gerhard Boenisch and Jens Kattge (Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany), and headed by DIVERSITAS/Future Earth, the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry and an international Steering Committee. TRY aims at developing a global archive of plant traits to make these data available for the scientific community.

These guidelines will be revised periodically and as a consequence they will be modified or ratified. All data custodians will be informed of modifications and will have the right to ratify or withdraw their participation.

## 1) Status of data contributed to the TRY initiative

An individual that directly contributes data to TRY is called a custodian. A custodian may be a person who owns the original data or may act as a representative of all individual contributors in a collective dataset. TRY will only deal with the custodian or deputy custodian. If the owners of a collective dataset already contributed to TRY decide to change the custodian, it will be their responsibility to inform TRY of the new situation.

Intellectual property rights in the data remain with the data custodian. Custodians retain the right to withdraw their data at any time.

Custodians choose one of the following three conditions under which their data will be made available via the TRY initiative:

Permission in each case: The custodian will be contacted each time a data request has the potential to involve these data. Explicit permission is necessary in each case before the data can be made available.

Permission by default: These data are available without the need for specific permission in case of each individual data request. The TRY database management will inform the custodian. If no objection is raised within two weeks, it will be assumed that the custodian has given permission to make these data available for the request in question.

Publicly available: These data are publicly available with open access. The custodian will be informed each time the data are requested and released unless she/he decides not to be informed.

The custodian may, at any time, change the availability status of her/his data.

The steering committee encourages data owners to make their data publicly available.

In the case of collective datasets that contain data that originally belong to several other people, it will be the custodians responsibility to solve intellectual property rights and authorship rules within the group of contributors. TRY will not take responsibility for data mishandling on the part of the custodians.

## 2) Data Requests

Individuals or groups of individuals that would like to use plant trait data via the TRY database submit a request to TRY, containing: (1) title and short information about the project; (2) name and email of the head (PI) of the request and of Co-PIs; (3) list of requested traits and selected species (optional); (4) explicit statement that all listed members of the request know and accept these intellectual property guidelines.

Title of projects and names of the PI and Co-PIs will be made public at the TRY website.

Requesting publicly available data: In case of requests that include only data in the category publicly available the requested data will be made available as soon as possible after the request has been submitted. The custodians will be informed.

Requesting restricted data: Restricted data (permission in each case or permission by default) ) are requested, the respective custodians will be informed based on the information about the project. Custodians will have two weeks to provide or withdraw permission. During this time custodians will have the opportunity to indicate if they require being involved in publications of the given project, and potentially become co-author, in case their data will be used in subsequent analyses.

## 3) Requirements in the context of publications

If data received via TRY are used for publications, the following requirements apply:

### Citation of data sources

The references of the individual datasets, as indicated by the custodians, and the standard reference of the TRY initiative should be cited in the methods section of any product that involves the datasets. The standard reference of the TRY initiative is currently:

Global Change Biology, 17:2905-2935.

### Involvement in manuscripts and authorship

Custodians of data and the TRY database managers (J. Kattge, G. Boenisch) should be invited to contribute to the development of manuscript/s, if they had indicated this requirement at the time of data request and if their data have been used in subsequent analyses. The PI of the request is expected to send the invitations at an early stage of manuscript preparation, so that valid suggestions by co-authors can still be accommodated. Co-authorship will be offered to those who respond to this invitation and to subsequent updates within a timely fashion (three weeks) with a significant contribution.

### Acknowledgement

The required acknowledgement of the TRY initiative is:

The study has been supported by the TRY initiative on plant traits (http://www.try-db.org). The TRY initiative and database is hosted, developed and maintained by J. Kattge and G. Boenisch (Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany). TRY is currently supported by DIVERSITAS/Future Earth and the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig.

## 4) Redistribution of trait data received via TRY

It is not allowed to redistribute trait data received via TRY, unless expressly permitted by the respective data custodian(s).

## 5) General comments

The PI of a request will be responsible that all use of data made available via TRY in the context of the given request will be in accordance with the TRY Intellectual Property Guidelines. Additional agreements between the PI of the request and individual data custodians need to be respected.

In case of misconduct, the database management will inform the PI and the respective custodians and ask the PI to correct his/her fault. If this does not happen to full consent, or if the misconduct is repeated, the TRY Steering Committee will make the misconduct public, e.g., inform involved journals and/or data repositories and eventually the home institution of the PI. If misconduct is repeated, the PI will be denied access to TRY data via new proposals, and authorization to use data received in the context of on-going proposals will be withdrawn.

Any issues not contemplated in these guidelines will be considered by the TRY Steering Committee.
